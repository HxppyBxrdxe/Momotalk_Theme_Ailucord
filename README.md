# What's new?
_(28/11/2024)_
It's released, that's all.

_(05/03/2025)_
A user has expressed concern with the theme not rendering properly on their phone. It's either an issue with Android 14 <sub>_(Has been noted before)_</sub>, or specifically the Redmi Note 13. I have no way of testing this, so I hope that it's just a once off issue. Sorry to anyone who has issues with it.

_(05/04/2025)_
Ailucord stopped working with UserBG, moved to Bunny. Trying to find out how to make themes on Vendetta based clients.
